# Weather-App
Creating a weather app using Javascript, HTML and CSS. It uses the Open Weather Map API to retrieve weather data and displays a mobile first responsive web design. 
This Vanilla JS app also features accessibility considerations, the geolocation API, persistent data storage, the Fetch API with Async / Await, and Serverless Functions.

Also took inspiration from the Weather Network app to make it dynamic.
